This is the downloadable code for my book, "Programming iOS 5: Fundamentals of iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch Development," published by O'Reilly in March 2012. It is the second edition of the book whose previous incarnation was "Programming iOS 4". (The example code from the first edition has been moved off into the folder called "iOS4bookExamples".)

The idea is that if you have the paper edition of the book, you shouldn't have to enter code examples by hand to try them out. And if you have an electronic edition of the book, copying and pasting the code and creating the surrounding Xcode project could be tricky.

The downloadable code examples here are all couched as Xcode projects. So all you have to do is open a project in Xcode and read it, build it, run it. I've tried to comment the code in such a way as to show you where to concentrate your attention.

In some projects, multiple examples are combined; usually in this case you are instructed to changed a `#define` from 1 to 2 and so forth and then run the project again.

Readers are encouraged to use this code as a starting place. Try tweaking things to see what difference it makes.

You may use this code in your own projects. What you may not do is pass off my examples as your own. If you cite code or anything else from the book, give proper credit.

If you find any issues with this code, please let me know or supply a patch.

NOTE ON PAGINATION: The projects are each in folders whose name starts with the chapter and page roughly corresponding to the position of that code in the actual book. I realize that the page numbers used in the folder names are not useful for those with the Kindle or ePUB editions, but they do keep the examples sorted in order, and they correspond to the pagination of the printed and PDF editions. The project names, inside the folders, will probably look like nonsense to you, as those names are inherited from the old pagination (from the first and second printings of the first edition); but that's of no importance, as you can just ignore those names. Perhaps I'll eventually get around to fixing them.

NOTE ON SCREENSHOTS: The full-resolution original screenshots from the book are included here as well.
